;; Assumptions made about the manager:
;; Every elected announcement is valid
;; The manager is up and running and properly configured before voting begins (there is now 'begin voting' announcement made by the manager)
;; no leader makes multiple elected announcements

;; Candidates do actually drop per caucus. Nice.
